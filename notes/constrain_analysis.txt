Constraint Analysis
	n <= 10: 
	O(n!) backtracking, permutations

	n <= 20: 
	O(2^n) algorithms
	bitmask DP, subset enumeration

	n <= 500
	O(n^3) algorithms (Floyd-warshall, DP with 3 dimensions)

	n <= 5000
	O(n^2) algorithms (nested loops, simple DP)

	n <= 10^6
	O(n logn) algorithms (sorting, binary search, segment trees)

	n <= 10^8 
	O(n) or O(log n) algorithms only
