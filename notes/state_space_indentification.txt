Concept Deep Dive:
	Every problem has a state space - the set of all possible configurations. 

	Explicit States: Array indices, tree nodes, and graph vertices. 

	Implicit States: Subproblems in DP, game positions, search states. 

	State Transitions: How to move from one state to another.

	Base Cases: Terminal states or trivial cases.
